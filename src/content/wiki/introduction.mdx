description: An introduction for beginners to the language server and Lua.

[Lua](https://lua.org/about.html) is a [scripting language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scripting_language), primarily designed to be embedded into other programs. Its simplicity and versatility results in it [being found everywhere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_applications_using_Lua) including games, compositing and audio software, databases, websites, and more. It is even [used in one of the largest websites in the world, Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Lua)

Lua can be used for simple scripts, like bash, using the official Lua interpreter, but it is most often found running inside C/C++ programs due to its simple C API and limited standard library. Extending Lua, often with [LuaRocks](https://luarocks.org/) modules, can make it very powerful, providing advanced support for filesystems, networking, and more.

## Lua's Superpower

Lua's superpower of being usable almost anywhere is also what can make development tooling very challenging. The environment in [Redis](https://redis.io/docs/latest/develop/programmability/eval-intro/) will look very different from [CC:Tweaked's](https://tweaked.cc/).

Sometimes, you may have an HTTP API available but no metatables, other times you will have a filesystem API, but no [debug library](https://www.lua.org/pil/23.html). Its adaptability is its greatest superpower, but it can also be viewed as a negative as no two environments will look the same. The Lua Language Server provides various configuration options to get a greatly improved development experience, even with some challenging runtime environments.

## Setting Up Your Workspace

If you haven't already, [install the Lua Language Server](/#install). Ignoring the many preferential settings for now, let's go through some of the [settings](/wiki/settings) that can help you [configure your workspace](/wiki/configuration/) for developing for various target environments.

### Setting Lua Version

The various Lua versions have subtle yet important differences. Use [runtime.version](/wiki/settings#runtimeversion) to set the Lua version. This will load the features as well as definitions for the standard libraries and functions of that Lua version.

### Disabling Standard Libraries

Using the [runtime.builtin](/wiki/settings#runtimebuiltin) setting, you can disable [standard libraries](https://www.lua.org/pil/contents.html#P3) such as `debug`, and some standard features like [coroutines](https://www.lua.org/pil/9.html). Many sandboxed runtimes such as in games will not contain the `debug`, `io`, and `os` libraries.

### Configuring Require Search Path

At runtime, [`require`](https://www.lua.org/pil/8.1.html) can be configured to search custom paths when loading a module via [`package.path`](https://www.lua.org/manual/5.1/manual.html#pdf-package.path). The Lua Language Server can be made aware of these custom require paths at dev time using the [runtime.path](/wiki/settings#runtimepath) setting.

### Loading External Code

The Lua Language Server will load and work on the files in your workspace, but you may need to load Lua that is outside of your workspace, for example, a LuaRocks package from `~/.luarocks/share/lua/5.3`. Alternatively, you may have created a [definition file](/wiki/definition-files) or installed an [addon](/wiki/addons) that describes runtime variables and functions. The [workspace.library](/wiki/settings#workspacelibrary) setting allows you to specify additional directories/files to load as part of the workspace.

## Recommendations

Even though Lua almost outright rejects being opinionated, in this section we'll provide some more opinion-based recommendations.

If you are working on a simple project, especially one where definitions are unlikely to be re-used, your [definitions](/wiki/definition-files) should be placed and committed under a `types/`, `stubs/`, or similar directory within your workspace. This means you don't have to use [workspace.library](/wiki/settings#workspacelibrary). For large projects, or when the definitions will be used in multiple projects, they should be packaged as an [addon](/wiki/addons) and loaded with [workspace.library](/wiki/settings#workspacelibrary).


Borrowing from TypeScript, [definition files](/wiki/definition-files) should be named `*.d.lua`, such as `filesystem.d.lua` so that they can quickly be identified as non-implementation ["meta"](/wiki/annotations#meta) code.
