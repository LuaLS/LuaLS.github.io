The language server is highly configurable. You can view all of the settings in [this wiki](/wiki/settings) or in the [JSON schema](https://github.com/LuaLS/vscode-lua/tree/master/setting), which is available in multiple languages.

The language server loads its settings from one of the following sources, in order of priority:

1. The file specified by [`--config-path`](/wiki/arguments#config-path).
2. A [`.luarc.json`]() file in the workspace.
3. The configuration file sent from the LSP client (like [`settings.json`](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/settings#_settingsjson) from VS Code).

# Configuration File

There are three kinds of configuration files that can be used:

- LSP [client-specific configuration](#client-configuration) file.
  - This is a configuration file that usually lives in your editor, like the [`settings.json`](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/settings#_settingsjson) file from VS Code. It is usually the easiest to use as the clients usually have their own tools for these.
- A [`.luarc.json`]() file **(recommended)**.
  - This file can be used between different clients/editors.
- A custom configuration file
  - A file of your choice written in either Lua or JSON.

# Client Configuration

Each client has their own specific method for configuring the language server. We go through some popular clients below:

## Visual Studio Code

Make sure you take note of whether you are editing your user-wide or [workspace
settings](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/settings#_workspace-settings).
Some settings you may want to always be in effect, these should be user settings.
Other settings like [`workspace.library`](/wiki/settings#workspace-library) _should_ be workspace only.

1. Press <kbd>Ctrl + ,</kbd> to open the settings page
2. Enter <code>@ext:sumneko.lua</code> in the search bar
3. Configure away!

## Neovim

Below are some examples for getting set up in Neovim in different environments.

    ### Using built-in LSP client
    </span>

Below is a minimal example showing how to set the runtime version of the language server.

```Lua
require'lspconfig'.lua_ls.setup{
  settings = {
    Lua = {
      runtime = {
        version = "LuaJIT"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

And here is an example that can be used when using Luarocks:

```Lua
require'lspconfig'.lua_ls.setup{
  settings = {
    Lua = {
      runtime = {
        version = 'Lua 5.3',
        path = {
          '?.lua',
          '?/init.lua',
          vim.fn.expand'~/.luarocks/share/lua/5.3/?.lua',
          vim.fn.expand'~/.luarocks/share/lua/5.3/?/init.lua',
          '/usr/share/5.3/?.lua',
          '/usr/share/lua/5.3/?/init.lua'
        }
      },
      workspace = {
        library = {
          vim.fn.expand'~/.luarocks/share/lua/5.3',
          '/usr/share/lua/5.3'
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

    ### Using [coc.nvim](https://github.com/neoclide/coc.nvim)
    </span>

1. Execute `:CocConfig;`
2. A JSON file should open
3. Configure away!

```JSON
{
  // Unrelated settings...
  "languageserver": {
    "lua": {
      "cwd": "full path to lua-language-server directory",
      "command": "full path to lua-language-server executable",

## Kakoune

  <span slot="summary">
  ### Using [kak-lsp](https://github.com/kak-lsp/kak-lsp)
  </span>

**Installation**

If using [plug.kak](https://github.com/andreyorst/plug.kak), place the following in your `kakrc`:

```
plug "kak-lsp/kak-lsp" do %{ cargo install --locked --force --path . }
```

If running standalone, place the `kak-lsp` binary on your `PATH` and then place the following in your `kakrc`:

```
evaluate-commands %sh{
  kak-lsp --kakoune -s $kak_session
}
```

---

**Initialization**

Place the following in your kakrc:

```
# Enable kak-lsp for Lua files
hook global WinSetOption filetype=lua %{
    lsp-enable-window
}
# Close kak-lsp when kakoune is terminated
hook global KakEnd .* lsp-exit
```

And the below in your kak-lsp.toml to inform it of the existence of the language server:

```toml
[language.lua]
filetypes = ["lua"]
roots = [".git/"]
command = "lua-language-server"
```

---

**Configuration**

To define server settings, place them under [language.lua.settings] in your kak-lsp.toml:

```toml
[language.lua.settings]
Lua.diagnostics.severity = { undefined-global = "Error" }
Lua.runtime.version = "Lua 5.2"
Lua.telemetry.enable = false
```

</Accordion>

# luarc.json File

A `.luarc.json` file can be added to your workspace to apply a certain
configuration to the server.

It is recommended you use a [JSON
schema](https://github.com/LuaLS/vscode-lua/tree/master/setting) to receive
completion and validation, if your editor supports it. In VS Code, the schema is
already injected into `.vscode/settings.json` and `.luarc.json` files.

Here is a basic example of a `.luarc.json` file:

```JSON
{
  "$schema": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sumneko/vscode-lua/master/setting/schema.json",
  "workspace.library": ["path/to/library/directory"],
  "runtime.version": "Lua 5.3",
  "hint.enable": false
}
```

<Remark type="note">
  Settings provided in a `.luarc.json` file do not need to be prefixed with
  `Lua.`
</Remark>

# Custom Configuration File

If you want to use your own custom configuration file, with whatever name you
please, that is also an option, although it must be written in either Lua or
JSON. This file can then be loaded by using the
[`--configpath`](/wiki/arguments#configpath) flag.

If writing the file in JSON, it should be formatted like a [`.luarc.json`](#luarcjson-file) file.

If writing the file in Lua, the configuration file can consist of nested tables;

```lua
return {
    Lua = {
        runtime = {
            version = "Lua 5.1"
        }
    }
}
```

keys;

```lua
return {
    ["Lua.runtime.version"] = "Lua 5.1"
}
```

or even a combination of both!

```lua
return {
    Lua = {
        runtime = {
            version = "Lua 5.1"
        },
        ["completion.enable"] = false
    }
}
```
