## Contributing code

If you're familiar with Lua, you can grab the [source code](https://github.com/LuaLS/lua-language-server) and dive in. There are additional wiki articles that go more in-depth on [building from source](/wiki/build) and [developing](/wiki/developing). An overview of the project's file structure can be found [on the developing page](/wiki/developing#file-structure).

We don't have a strict git workflow that needs to be followed. When you have some changes ready to merge, [open a pull request](https://github.com/LuaLS/lua-language-server/pulls). If you need some help, feel free to open a draft pull request â€“ although please be patient and keep in mind that the team is very small.

When making changes to the language server, please make sure to add an entry to the project's [changelog](https://github.com/LuaLS/lua-language-server/blob/master/changelog.md) file, so it is documented and advertised to users.

## Contributing LuaCATS Annotations

The Lua Language Server implements a system for defining and documenting code called LuaCATS (Lua Comment And Type System). You can contribute to our ecosystem by writing [LuaCATS annotations](/wiki/annotations) for widely used Lua libraries. These can help give users out-of-the-box autocompletion and type checking for the library. This is done by creating [definition files](/wiki/definition-files) that can then be included in an [addon](/wiki/addons) and distributed using the [addon manager](/wiki/addons#addon-manager).

You can browse annotations maintained by the community in the [LuaCATS organization](https://github.com/LuaCATS).
