Addons can be used to add additional content for the Lua Language Server by doing the following:

- Providing [definitions](/wiki/definition-files) for a framework/library/API.
- Including a [plugin](/wiki/plugins).
- Modifying a user's [settings](/wiki/settings).

They can then be published to the [addon manager](#addon-manager) using the [LLS-Addons repository](https://github.com/LuaLS/LLS-Addons).

<Remark type="note">
  Addons are a refresh of what were previously called "third-party libraries".

## Built-In Addons

There are a number of addons that come with the language server that can be found in [`meta/3rd`](https://github.com/LuaLS/lua-language-server/tree/master/meta/3rd).

<Remark type="deprecated">
  The built-in addons [are going to be removed in a future
  version](https://github.com/LuaLS/lua-language-server/discussions/1950).
</Remark>

## Installing Addons

<Remark type="note">
  If you use Visual Studio Code, addons can easily be installed using the [addon
  manager](#addon-manager). The below are instructions for **manually**
  installing an addon.
</Remark>

Addons can be installed from anywhere, however, many popular addons can be found in the [LLS-Addons][LLS-Addons] repository, an official collection of community addons used by the [addon manager](#addon-manager). The intention with the repository is that each addon is its own sub-repository (submodule) so that they can be forked and downloaded easily.

While addons can be installed from anywhere, we are going to go through installing from [LLS-Addons][LLS-Addons]. Take a look through the [`addons/`](https://github.com/LuaLS/LLS-Addons/tree/main/addons) directory and open up your desired addon. Clicking `module` will bring you to the repository where that addon lives. You can then download the zip for that addon and unzip it to some directory, any directory, on your computer (e.g. `C:\Users\me\Documents\LuaAddons`). You can place any future addons in this directory as well, just make sure they are contained within their own directory (see below). Then add the path to this parent directory to [`workspace.userThirdParty`](/wiki/settings/#workspaceuserthirdparty).

```plaintext
📂 LuaAddons/
    ├── 📂 Addon1/
    │    ├── 📁 library/
    │    ├── 📜 config.json
    │    └── 📜 plugin.lua
    └── 📂 Addon2/
         ├── 📁 library/
         └── 📜 config.json
```

So in this case, your setting could look like this in your [configuration file](/wiki/configuration#configuration-file):

```JSON
{
  "Lua.workspace.userThirdParty": ["C:\Users\me\Documents\LuaAddons"]
}
```

## Enabling Addons

Addons often define some configuration values in their `config.json` file that are meant to be automatically applied, however, they can still be applied manually.

<Remark type="note">
  Again, this can be easily done using the [addon manager](#addon-manager) in
  Visual Studio Code instead.
</Remark>

### Automatically Enabling

If the addon in question has been configured to allow automatic enabling and it has been placed in a directory specified in [`workspace.userThirdParty`](/wiki/settings#workspaceuserthirdparty), you will be prompted to enable it once certain critera is met. The critera is defined by the addon in its [`config.json`](#configjson) file - this could be, for example, using require on the library or naming a file a certain way.

### Manually Enabling

If the addon contains a `library/` directory, you will want to paste the full path to that directory in your [`workspace.library`](/wiki/settings#workspace-userThirdParty) setting. This will enable the provided [definition files](/wiki/definition-files/).

If the [`config.json`](#configjson) contains settings, you will have to manually copy them to your configuration file.

## Addon Manager

The addon manager, which is currently only available in Visual Studio Code, allows you to browse and install addons from [LLS-Addons][LLS-Addons]. It manages downloading addons and applying modifications to your [configuration file](/wiki/configuration#configuration-file).

The addon manager can be opened from the command palette <kbd>Ctrl + P</kbd> by running the "Open Addon Manager" command (`lua.addon_manager.open`).

  <source src="/videos/wiki/addon-manager.webm" type="video/webm" />
  <source src="/videos/wiki/addon-manager.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
</video>

The addon manager is a [webview](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/extension-guides/webview) (basically an iframe) that contains a [Vue.js webapp](https://github.com/LuaLS/vscode-lua-webvue).

If you have feedback on the addon manager, please leave it in the [vscode-lua repository](https://github.com/LuaLS/vscode-lua) <Icon name="heart" group="solid" color="red"/>.

## Creating an Addon

To create an addon, you will want to first create a directory where all your files will live. If you intend to [publish your addon](https://github.com/LuaLS/LLS-Addons/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#adding-an-addon) to [LLS-Addons][LLS-Addons], you will also want a remote repository where people can access it. Both GitHub and GitLab have been confirmed to work, although any service that provides Git cloning over HTTP should work.

### Addon Anatomy

An addon that contains definitions should place them in a `library/` directory. You can use the [LuaLS/addon-template](https://github.com/LuaLS/addon-template) to get up and running a little bit quicker.

```plaintext
📂 myAddon/
    ├── 📁 library/
    │    ├── 📜 http.lua
    │    └── 📜 error.lua
    ├── 📜 plugin.lua
    └── 📜 config.json
```

### Definition Files

The [definition files](/wiki/definition-files) should live in the `library/` directory and should start with a [`@meta`](/wiki/annotations#meta) annotation. They can use [LuaCATS annotations](/wiki/annotations) just like any Lua code.

### Plugins

A [plugin](/wiki/plugins) can be included simply by placing it in the addon folder and naming it `plugin.lua`.

### config.json

The `config.json` file is very important for addons and must be included. A schema for it can be found at [`LLS-Addons/schemas/addon.schema.json`](https://github.com/LuaLS/LLS-Addons/blob/main/schemas/addon_config.schema.json). You can also browse some of the addons in that repository to see how the `config.json` file can be used. The `settings` array can contain any [settings for the language server](/wiki/settings), as well as any VS Code settings, if applicable.

```JSON
{
    // Name of the addon
    "name": "My Awesome Addon",

    // Lua string patterns to look for in a workspace.
    // If detected, this addon will be recommended to enable
    "words": [ "require[%s%(\"']+MAA[%)\"']" ],

    // Lua string patterns to look for in filenames.
    // If detected, this addon will be recommended to enable
    "files": ["my-awesome-file.lua"],

    // List of settings to apply when this addon is enabled
    "settings": {
        "Lua.diagnostics.globals" : [
            "awesome"
        ]
    }
}
```
