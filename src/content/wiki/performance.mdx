import Remark from "~/components/common/Remark.astro";

## Background

This benchmark tests the Lua Language Server with the Visual Studio Code extension client against a real project that contains 1500 Lua files with a total size of 20MB.

The CPU used is an i7-9700K. The project files are located on a HDD and the server is on an SSD.

## Results

After many tests, the loading of the 20MB workspace takes about 10 seconds, meaning the loading speed is ~2MB/s.

<Remark type="note">
  Because the test was repeated multiple times, the OS cached some of the
  operations, so the above performance will be better than the actual
  performance.

<Remark type="note">
  In actuality, step 2 and 3 are merged, which can save about 0.5 sec.

### Conclusion

According to the test, the most time-consuming part is compiling Lua files into abtract syntax trees. This time is matching expectations, so there may be no room for improvement.

Step 2 is affected by the total number of files in your workspace (including non Lua files).

The best way to improve startup times is to [exclude unnecessary files and directories](/wiki/settings#workspaceignoredir) and to not load unnecessary [libraries](/wiki/settings/#workspacelibrary).
